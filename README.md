## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze **AI and Data Science techniques** used in movie recommender systems.
- Examine **ethical concerns** in AI-powered recommendation engines.
- Investigate **bias in recommendation algorithms**.
- Propose **solutions for fair and transparent AI recommendations**.

---

## 📊 Methodology
This study leveraged **Kaggle's IMDB dataset**, containing **45,000 movies and 26 million ratings from 27,000 users**. The following methods were applied:

1️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values, normalized data, and performed feature engineering.

2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Examined user behavior, movie popularity, and rating distribution.

3️⃣ **Implementation of Recommender Models**  
   - Developed **Simple, Content-Based, Collaborative Filtering, and Hybrid Recommender Systems**.

4️⃣ **Ethical Review & Analysis**  
   - Evaluated how different algorithms impact users and their experiences.

---

## 🏆 Findings & Results
- **Simple Recommenders** prioritize mainstream content, reinforcing biases.
- **Content-Based Filtering** improves personalization but lacks diversity in recommendations.
- **Collaborative Filtering** is prone to **activity bias and gender discrimination**, with female users often receiving less accurate recommendations.
- **Hybrid Approaches** enhance accuracy but **raise concerns about data privacy and user profiling**.
- AI-driven recommenders **influence user decisions**, with **opaque algorithms limiting transparency and accountability**.

## ⚖️ Ethical Issues Identified

| 🛑 Ethical Concern            | 📝 Description |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| **Privacy Violations**        | AI collects and processes vast amounts of user data, raising GDPR compliance concerns. |
| **Algorithmic Bias**          | Users from marginalized groups receive less relevant recommendations due to biased training data. |
| **Lack of Transparency**      | Users often do not understand why specific movies are recommended. |
| **Polarization & Manipulation** | Streaming services can promote specific content, influencing public opinion and personal preferences. |
| **Autonomy & Personal Identity** | AI-driven recommendations can limit users' choices, shaping their viewing habits unconsciously. |

---

## ✅ Proposed Solutions
- **Increased Transparency**: Providing users with explanations for recommendations.
- **Algorithm Audits**: Regular evaluations to **detect and mitigate bias**.
- **User Control**: Allowing users to modify recommendation criteria.
- **Stronger Privacy Protections**: Enforcing **GDPR compliance** and anonymizing user data.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
- **Machine Learning Models** (KNN, K-Means, Matrix Factorization)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Implement **deep learning-based recommendation models** for better personalization.
- Conduct **real-world user studies** to evaluate ethical concerns in live environments.
- Apply **Fair AI techniques** to mitigate bias in recommendation systems.
