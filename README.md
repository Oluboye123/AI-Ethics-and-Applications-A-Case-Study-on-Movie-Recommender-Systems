# 🎬 AI Ethics and Applications: The Role of AI & Data Science in Recommender Systems

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the ethical implications of **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science** in recommender systems, focusing on how these technologies impact decision-making, privacy, and fairness. We analyzed the **advantages, risks, and ethical concerns** associated with AI-powered recommendations in platforms such as **Netflix, Amazon Prime, and YouTube**. Our study delves into **how organizations process user data**, how AI influences human behavior, and the ethical trade-offs that arise from algorithm-driven decision-making.

## 📊 Findings & Results

### 🤖 AI's Role in Movie Recommender Systems
AI-powered recommendation engines **analyze user behavior and preferences** to suggest movies, TV shows, and content. The most commonly used approaches include:
- **Simple Recommender Systems**: Suggests popular content without personalization.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses metadata such as genre, director, and actors to recommend similar movies.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends content based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine multiple techniques for better accuracy.

### ⚖️ Ethical Concerns Identified
| 🛑 Ethical Concern            | 📝 Description |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| **Privacy Violations**        | AI collects and processes vast amounts of user data, raising GDPR compliance concerns. |
| **Algorithmic Bias**          | Users from marginalized groups receive less relevant recommendations due to biased training data. |
| **Lack of Transparency**      | Users often do not understand why specific movies are recommended. |
| **Polarization & Manipulation** | Streaming services can promote specific content, influencing public opinion and personal preferences. |
| **Autonomy & Personal Identity** | AI-driven recommendations can limit users' choices, shaping their viewing habits unconsciously. |

### 📈 Statistical Insights from the Dataset
- **Highly rated movies are often over-recommended**, reducing exposure to diverse content.
- **Younger audiences (18-34) receive more personalized recommendations than older users.**
- **Gender-based disparities** were found, with female users often receiving different recommendations compared to male users.
- **Content similarity bias** led to **narrowed choices**, reinforcing user preferences instead of exposing them to diverse options.
